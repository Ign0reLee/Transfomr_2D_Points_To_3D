# How to use it

  Now it is not completed yet, so maybe it will change

  ```cmd
  python transform.py --path_2d YOUR2DPOINTSPATH --path3d YOUR3DPOINTSPATH --translate TRANSLATEFACTORYOUWANT
  ```

  --path_2d   : directory path of 2d points files
  --path_3d   : directory path of 3d points files
  --translate : Translation factor, Default : 30
